# Session 2
This session will deal with Data Gathering. Data gathering is fundamental for effective machine learning as it forms the basis upon which models are trained, validated, and improved, directly impacting the model's accuracy, reliability, and applicability in solving real-world problems. 

**THE MODEL CAN ONLY BE AS GOOD AS THE DATA.**

We will cover topics on where to find free available data, how to scrape data from web and how to begin loading data into [Dataframes](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/what-are-dataframes) using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

### Free and available Data sources
There are several other free and available sources out there but these are ones that I have experince with over the years.

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (personal fave)

- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets)

- [Data World](https://data.world/)

- [data.gov](https://data.gov/) 

- [Google](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)

- [NASA Earth Data](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/?_fsi=BqJ6IiI5)


### Setup
Let's begin by learning how to scrape data from the web because it is one way to obtain data and it is also fun.

1) Setup your Python environment as we did in Session 1.

2)  Start Jupyter and Open the `Data Gathering Session 2.ipynb`. 
```
jupyter lab
```

Follow the steps of the Notebook.

## Try on your own
1) Take a look around Kaggle at some data sources that you may be interested in.

2) Download the data and load it into Pandas and do some analysis, cleanup, etc...

3) Maybe do some research on web scraping with Beautiful Soup and Selenium. There is a lot of power things that can be done.
