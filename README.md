# CSCC Mentor Project 2023-24
A collaborative Machine Learning Project for CSCC Mentorship Program 2023-2024. In this project we will walk through several "real world" scenarios of what it is like to build an ML Project as an Machine Learning Engineer. Major goals of the project include: 1) Code Collaboration, 2) Learning to work with Python and 3) walking through the steps of building an ML Application. 4) A "case study" evaluating XGBoost.


## Learning Objectives
- Learn To Collaborate in a Repo
    - Submitting Code reviews
    - Completing new features
    - Merging code

- Learn to Work in Python
    - Setup an IDE
    - Setup an Environment
    - Work in a Notebook

- Complete Steps in a "real" ML Project
    - Data Gathering
    - Data Labeling
    - Data Cleaning
    - Model Training
    - Model Serving (HTTP API)
    - Model Evaluation
    - Bonus: UI App

## Project Overview
The ML App will take some text as an input and then make an estimate on the sentiment of the text. We will be using reviews from Yelp and out ML model will guess if the review is positive, neutral or negative.
