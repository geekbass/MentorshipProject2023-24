Our drinks, a seasonal cranberry margarita (picture included) was pretty good and looked beautiful, but this pineapple margarita thing we ordered was just phenomenal. I'd recommend both. <br/><br/>Queso was not my favorite but it was still tasty. Guac was good and so were the two other sauces that came with it. Sorry I do not know the names of them, but that green one was amazing, tasted so fresh.<br/><br/>There were so many of us, we pretty much got the entire taco menu. My favorite was the short rib one, least favorite was the Huitlacoche (it was still pretty good though, and I think it's vegetarian). Pollo (verde? Asado? Chicken something..) was great as well... they're all great! You go order them all! Overall, awesome spot with great food, drinks, and service.

The recipes seem more commercial to me, and the tacos are much more saucy than I'm used to. I much prefer the mom and pop family-owned joints where it all started with a really great home cook who had big dreams and a whole lot of hustle. <br/><br/>We had the esquites and it was decent but honestly was just too dressed up and standardized. Street food is messy and unmeasured and often falling off the plate or out of your hands or whatever is holding it in place. This was well-plated so not quiiiiitte authentic, yeah? The flavor was accordingly just not as robust and complex as I'd like. But good enough. <br/><br/>We had a sampling of tacos--I think the carnitas, al pastor, fish, and beef short rib (because, what? no carne asada or bistec???). They are small--as street tacos are--but again: too pretty and too saucy, and too much stuff. All I need on my tacos is cilantro and onion and a squeeze of lime, and maybe a couple of slices of red radish. <br/><br/>Bakersfield is good enough if you're looking to hang out in the Short North and enjoy a Mexican-themed dining experience with friends, but if you're really looking for good, authentic street tacos there is a multitude of Mexican (and other Latine) food trucks and family-owned restaurants throughout the city that truly are the real deal.</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__ZU8MN truncated__09f24__lSBbT css-qgunke\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\">We appreciate your feedback, Celina.

I was craving a fresh salad and decided on the Willie with chicken. Size wise - it was perfect. Just enough to satisfy me and leave room for dessert. On a fullness scale, I'd say a 6.5/10. The bacon and queso fresco really stood out in terms of flavor. The amount of chicken added was pitiful, but the bacon made up for it. I was happy with the dish overall. <br/><br/>Even after a football game in the busy Short North, the service was great. Our waiter was attentive and helpful with explaining the menu to the first timers in our group. I always love this place and will continue to go back. If you've never been to this restaurant, definitely order three tacos because they're quite small.</span></p>, <p class=\"comment__09f24__ZU8MN truncated__09f24__lSBbT css-qgunke\"><span class=\"raw__09f24__T4Ezm\">Thank you for your review, Diana!
